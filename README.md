Welcome to my official repo
I use it as a place to store a few projects of mine rather than actual version control - please don't expect a real project history for the contents.

# SNAKE 
is my first trial in Pygame:
at the current state it turned out to eye-opening in terms of problems in a more complex class inheritance, the pythonic 'passing-by-assignment' concept and dividing a project into smaller modules being separate files.
From my perspective it requires a major refactor.

# WEBSCRAP
is a tiny project to scrap user-posted data (kilometers of running that were posted by community).
As far as it worked I abandoned the project due to the fact that another user developed a script of his own for automated posting and storing historical data.
