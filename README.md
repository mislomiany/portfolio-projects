Welcome to my official repo  
I use it as a place to store a few projects of mine rather than actual version control - please don't expect a real project history for the contents.

# QUERY_EDIT (py)
a tiny script per my wife's request:  
it edits all *.txt files in a directory and outputs new ones with lines to be used in CREATE TABLE. She's never specified all the manual work she needs to perform on the output to complete a query, so it is rather a useful action-ready regex.

# SNAKE (py)
is my first trial in Pygame:  
at the current state it turned out to eye-opening in terms of problems in a more complex class inheritance, the pythonic 'passing-by-assignment' concept and dividing a project into smaller modules being separate files.
From my perspective it requires a major refactor.

# WEBSCRAP (py)
is a tiny project to scrap user-posted data (kilometers of running that were posted by community).
As far as it worked I abandoned the project due to the fact that another user developed a script of his own for automated posting and storing historical data.
